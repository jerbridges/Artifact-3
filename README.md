  I have included as my artifact of databases an HTML interface to interact with a MongoDB database.  The original project was completed in April 2020 and involved using Python and Bottle to create a RESTful server which could take HTTP commands and interact with the MongoDB database.  The RESTful server had to be reworked to be able to take input from an HTML form.  This enhancement required learning some basics of JavaScript as well as HTML to complete the objective.  I included this artifact in my portfolio because databases are a part of my potential career path and it shows strong understanding of database manipulation with the Python and HTML languages.  Course objectives were met, and no updates are required to the outcome plan.  One challenged encountered was HTTP supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE commands but HTML only supports POST and GET.  But we were able to use POST operator to also update and delete records in the database.  The enhancement of the artifact required some quick learning and inspired me to learn more of the JavaScript language since it is a very flexible and useful language.
